      <p>Hello, I am Van Raj Thakur studying at Lovely Professional University in my 3rd year. I am passionate about web development and love to explore the world of coding and designing websites. My journey in web development started a few years ago, and ever since then, I have been fascinated by how I can bring my ideas to life on the internet.</p>
      <p>During my time at the university, I have gained valuable knowledge in various web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. I believe in continuously learning and improving my skills to stay updated with the latest trends in the industry.</p>
      <p>Web development is not just a career path for me; it's a creative outlet that allows me to express my ideas and make a positive impact on the digital world. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer.</p>
      <p>Outside of coding, I love to engage in various extracurricular activities and collaborate with like-minded individuals to create innovative solutions. My goal is to become a well-rounded web developer and contribute to the tech community.</p>
      <p>I am excited about the future and the endless possibilities that web development offers. Thank you for visiting my profile!</p>
